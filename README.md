This is a solution for the "flood fill puzzle game" described on [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/5jxeal/20161223_challenge_296_hard_flood_fill_puzzle_game/).

The program uses a brute force method with various optimizations to find the least amount of steps required to solve a board.

The algorithm is fast enough to complete most 4x4 and 5x5 without your patience running out.

It will take some time to solve the more complex 6x6 and 7x7 boards.

But overall, this program has a nice UI, plus various additional features such as "undo" and reading/writing to files.
